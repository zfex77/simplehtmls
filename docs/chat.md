# [SimpleChat](https://simplechat.pages.dev/)
A quite simple chat application that uses the PubNub API. This is the offical documentation on it, and this will be the page for updates, upcoming updates, and how to even work the thing out. Though, I will point out, there are some things about this application that **you** should know.

The general chat rooms (and private channels) are not **moderated** whatsoever. If someone says something obscene, there is basically nothing I can do about it.

Anyway, how do you even use the site? How does it work? What are some features and bugs?

## Known Bugs/Lacking Features*
- *[BUG]* Message history basically doesn't exist.
- *[LACKING FEATURE]* Time of message.
- *[LACKING FEATURE]* Deleting messages.
- *[LACKING FEATURE]* Editing messages.

## How to Simply Chat
### How to send messages?
All you really do is type a message into the input field and just press enter (or click the send button.)

### How to create a private channel, and how do I share it?
Press the "create channel button," and it should generate a random channel that you can share to your friends! **It will** redirect you so just copy the link from the bar. A working private channel link should look like this: "https://simplechat.pages.dev/?channel=custom-channel-zouorv"

There's a reason it's called simple. 

That's literally it. Nothing else.

Enjoy simply chatting folks!
