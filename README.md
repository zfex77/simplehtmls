# Simple HTMLs

These are just SimpleHTMLs that do simple functions. I will update stuff when I feel like it. ALSO, BIG DISCLAIMER, I am not coding this myself, I am using ChatGPT to code this as this is just a simple experiment for some things that I find slighty useful. **AGAIN, I HAVE CODED ALMOST NOTHING THAT IS HERE**, as **CHATGPT** has for me. This is basically an experiment.
