## <ins>Two Ways to Access</ins>
- If you're connected to the internet and want to access the SimpleHTMLs go on over to https://zfex77.github.io/simplehtmls/
- To download the latest version to run locally just [download it.](https://github.com/zfex77/simplehtmls/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) It should work just by putting all the HTMLs **(IN THE SAME DIRECTORY... VERY IMPORTANT)** and running the index.html
