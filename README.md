# Simple HTMLs

These are just SimpleHTMLs that do simple functions. I will update suff when I feel like it.

## <ins>Two Ways to Access</ins>
- If you're connected to the internet and want to access the SimpleHTMLs go on over to https://zfex77.github.io/simplehtmls/
- To download the latest version to run locally just [download it.](https://github.com/zfex77/simplehtmls/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) It should work just by putting all the HTMLs **(IN THE SAME DIRECTORY... VERY IMPORTANT)** and running the index.html

## <ins>Under Development ⚒️</ins>
At the moment, the [image editor SimpleHTML](https://github.com/zfex77/simplehtmls/blob/main/in%20development%20(will%20be%20deleted%20after%20finished)/image.html) is under development. You might ask... _**why?**_
- The UI isn't that great
- The contrast and brightness sliders are buggy
- Need to implement Bootstrap for the interface
- Also... I want to add more features to make it more useful.

I'll get this done within a couple of days. I will update this doc with my progress.

- [x] Under Development
- [ ] Implement Features
- [ ] Polish with Bootstrap
- [ ] Bug Check
- [ ] Finished
